# slider-native-js
Simple slider writting on clear JS by me. Photos are situated in db.json as an object with name and source. Photos places on web page if your click button "Show slider". Also you can add your photos using two inputs: name and source and click button "Add photo". I get and post slides with fetch. Slider has prev and next buttons and navigation dots also.
